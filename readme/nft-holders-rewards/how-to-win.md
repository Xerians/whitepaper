# How To Win

The number of tickets depends on the type and rarity of each NFT card ,

| TYPE & RARITY              | NUMBER OF TICKETS |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Chieftain - Heroic         | 5                 |
| Unique Xerian - Super Rare | 4                 |
| Xerian Soldiers - Rare     | 3                 |
| Xerian Soldiers - Epic     | 2                 |
| Xerian Soldiers - Common   | 1                 |

NFTs are eligible to have tickets only after being opened.

For instance, a Xern has bought and minted 3 mystery boxes and opened 2 of them. One is chieftain (that has Heroic rarity for sure) and one Xerian soldier (with epic rarity). In Xerians' NFT Draw :

| MYSTERY BOXES | NFT INSIDE             | NUMBER OF TICKETS WON |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1st           | Chieftain (Super Rare) | 5                     |
| 2nd           | Xerian soldier (Epic)  | 2                     |
| 3rd           | Not opened             | 0                     |

Each NFT is eligible to win tickets of the NFT Draw of its own phase. If the mystery box is not opened yet in 7 days after sold out, it cannot join either the NFT Draw of its own phase or any  NFT Draws of following Minting Phases.

NFT Rewards will be dropped to crypto wallets of Xerns in 15 days after the NFT Draw .
