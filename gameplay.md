### Phase 1

Xerians Card owners will take their places in Battle Arenas where 3vs3 matches will be occurred and these arenas will be leveraged according to score and ticket prices

&#x20;

Each Xerian will be allowed to play its own score ranged room. Xerians will get a score upgrade if its team wins the battle and each Xerian will get a score downgrade if its team loses the game. With this rule each Xerian will get upgrade/downgrade and may play in high or low rated rooms.&#x20;

&#x20;

Xerian Card Owners will randomly take place into the team and eligible battle arena by buying battle tickets

&#x20;

&#x20;

When 3vs3 teams are completed, the game triggers the simulation.

&#x20;

This function ensures that every player can beat others irrespective of cards scores. Team working on format and will be shared with community before games begin.

&#x20;

Each Xerian Card will be upgradable and open to get higher scores. All layers of card will be replaceable with higher rated parts. All parts will be on sale in marketplace. If Xerian Card Owners replace a layer with higher scored one, they will have chance to put on sale older and lower scored one in marketplace

500 $XRNS \* 6 = 3000 $XRNS (total revenue of battle)

3000 $XRNS \* %84 = 2520 $XRNS (Winners will share it)

&#x20;

2520 $XRNS \* %40 = 1008 $XRNS

Second Higher Player

2520 $XRNS \* %34 = 856.8 $XRNS

Third Higher Player

2520 $XRNS \* %26 = 655.2 $XRNS
