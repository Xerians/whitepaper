# Game Mechanics

Xerns can play in matches with their Xerians. The chance of winning will be increased as the total skill score of a Xerian increases. The total skill score of each Xerian depends on the character type, layers, races, Xerenas and the match history.&#x20;

All Xerians have 9 layers: 5 body parts, 1 card and 3 boosters. Each body part stands for a different skill (Head for Intelligence, Body for Strength, Arms for Power, Legs for Speed and Backpack for Strategy). Cards and boosters multiply particular skills according to their type.&#x20;

In Xerian Universe, there are 3 character types. They will be generated randomly and categorized according to their card and skill scores. Chieftains are the strongest. Unique Xerians follow them by being the second strongest; and Xerian Soldiers have the lowest rarity scores. Chieftains and Unique Xerians won’t be separated into layers; Xerian Soldiers will have separated body parts that are replaceable and upgradeable.&#x20;

In addition to layers, there are also Races that boost the skill scores for Unique Xerians and Xerian Soldiers in Xerian Universe as each Unique Xerian represents a Race. Body parts of Xerians belong to different Races. The Race belonging to the majority of the body parts determines a Xerians’ Race. In a case where there isn’t a majority Race, the Head’s race determines the Race.&#x20;

1v1 or 3v3 matches take place on Xerenas (Xerenas also have multipliers for each skill score of a Xerian). Xerns are only allowed to play in their own skill score ranged rooms. To provide a fair game, Xerns can’t see Xerenas’ multipliers or potential team members; they only see the ticket prices.&#x20;

A match starts when all slots are filled. The order of players is randomly allocated; the competing skills are chosen randomly. In 3v3 matches, the total score of a team is equal to the sum of each player’s skill scores.&#x20;

The team’s total scores of each skill are determined by individual Xerians’ layers (body parts, a booster, and a card color), multipliers of races, and Xerenas’ multipliers. At the end of the match, the winner(s) increase their Xerians’ skill scores and get a percentage of the match’s total prize pool (sum of the ticket prices). The losing team’s Xerians’ skill scores are deducted.
