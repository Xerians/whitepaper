# Cards & Rarity

Xerians’ Cards will be determined according to the type of Xerians and overall skill scores. Chieftains come with Black and Unique Xerians come with Diamond cards. Xerians Soldiers’ cards depend on the skill score leaderboard: the highest 1760 total skill-scored cards will have Emerald; following 3500 will have Ruby and next 5500 will have Gold. Therefore the rarity of Chieftains and Unique Xerians are fixed but Xerian Soldiers depend on the leaderboard.
