# Races & Skills

There are 10 unique races in Xerians Universe. Each Unique Xerian represents a different race. Each race boosts a particular skill. For Xerian Soldiers, each body part can have a different or the same race. A Xerians’ race is determined by the race that has the higher number of body parts. In the case of equal number of body parts (1-1-1-1-1 and 2-2-1), the race will be determined according to Head’s race.&#x20;

The races in Gen 1 are listed below:

|    |              |
| -- | ------------ |
| 1  | Xaquarian    |
| 2  | Xamberian    |
| 3  | Xionian      |
| 4  | Xopazrian    |
| 5  | Xyanirian    |
| 6  | Xapphirian   |
| 7  | Xemeraldian  |
| 8  | Xamorian     |
| 9  | Xavaxian     |
| 10 | Xalesarian   |



**Example 1**: NFT Card No 5687

|                |             |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| **BODY PARTS** | **RACE**    |
| HEAD           | XIONIAN     |
| ARMS           | XEMERALDIAN |
| LEGS           | XAMORIAN    |
| BODY           | XALESARIAN  |
| BACKPACK       | XALESARIAN  |

The majority of parts belong to XALESARIAN, so No:5687 belongs to the RACE of XALESARIAN.

If there is no majority between races, the race is determined according to Head’s race.



**Example 2:** NFT Card No 5699&#x20;

|                |           |
| -------------- | --------- |
| **BODY PARTS** | **RACE**  |
| HEAD           | XYANIRIAN |
| ARMS           | XAQUARIAN |
| LEGS           | XOPAZRIAN |
| BODY           | XOPAZRIAN |
| BACKPACK       | XAQUARIAN |

In this case, 2 parts are of Xaquarian race, the other 2 come from Xopazrian race. Since there is no majority of one singular race, Head race is taken in consideration. No:5699 belongs to the RACE of XYANIRIAN.
