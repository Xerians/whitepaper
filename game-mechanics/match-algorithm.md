# Match Algorithm

![](../.gitbook/assets/match-mechanisms-08.jpg)





The total score is the multiplier-applied skill scores of Xerians: the total score comes from the body parts and boosters will be multiplied according to Xerena, card type and race.

A match starts when all slots are filled. The order of players is randomly allocated; one team hits first, then the other team hits. This goes turn by turn until a team loses all of their skills scores. Both sides’ hits are based on a randomly chosen skill.

Example Flow:

Transaction 1 : Team Selection ( Random Selection -> Team 1)

Transaction 2 : Team 1 Skill Selection ( Random Selection -> INT ) Total Score 170,5&#x20;

Transaction 3 : Team 2 Skill Selection ( Random Selection -> POW) Total Score 207,9&#x20;

Transaction 4 – Hit&#x20;

INT>POW (In Transaction 1 above, Team 1 was selected randomly to make the hit)

**Xerena multiplier is 1,1 for skill INT as shown on the table in section "Xerenas (Arenas)"**

Team 1 INT Total score = 170,5\*1,1=187,55

Team 2  POW Total score = 207,9

First hit comes from Team 1 skill INT to Team  2 skill POW.&#x20;

It means POW skill score of TEAM 2 is subtracted from INT skill score of TEAM 1

**207,9-187,55 = 20,35**

POW skill score of Team 2 is made   20,35 after hit

In summary, the skill score of the team that makes the hit stays the same , the other team loses as many points as the score of the hitter.

When it is the turn of Team 2, the same mechanism works in the game. The team that loses the skill points loses the match.

The winning team members  share the loot by its own rank based on card power. In addition, all winning team members gain 0,5 points in total to all their skills and on the contrary 0,5 points will be deducted totally from skill scores of the members of the losing team.

In above example , 0,5 points is added to all skills of Team 1.
