Xerns can lock their Xerians to upgrade their skills until the beta version of the Game is Released for all users (during the testing period, upgrades will still be available). The steps to follow to upgrade a skill:&#x20;

1. Choose one of Xeriansâ€™ skills (Intelligence, Strength, Power, Speed, Strategy)
2. Choose a term of staking (7 days, 15 days, 30 days, 90 days)&#x20;
3. Choose the speed of upgrading and make the payment. (1X = 1500 $XRNS, 2X = 3000 $XRNS, 3X = 4500 $XRNS)

Owners can follow the same instructions to get more upgrade chances.&#x20;

Example:  You are a Xern with a Xerian Card Score separated according to properties.&#x20;

1. Decide to stake your Xerian Card and choose Strategy property for staking.&#x20;
2. Upgrade it faster in a short time and choose '2X' speed and '7 days' term for stake.&#x20;
3. Pay 3000 $XRNS and 7 Days Upgrade Score&#x20;
4. Stake your card for 7 days and upgrade your score to 8.36
