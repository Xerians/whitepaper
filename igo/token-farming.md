Xerns can lock their Xerians to upgrade their skills until the beta version of the Game is Released for all users (during the testing period, upgrades will still be available). The steps to follow to upgrade a skill:



1. Choose one of Xeriansâ€™ skills (Intelligence, Strength, Power, Speed, Strategy)
2. Choose a term of staking (7 days, 15 days, 30 days, 90 days)
3. Choose the speed of upgrading and make the payment. (1X = 1500 $XRNS, 2X = 3000 $XRNS, 3X = 4500 $XRNS)
